# hello-world
This is my first, test repository.
My name is Gen and I dream of becoming a web developer. I am starting with the most basic knowledge of how HTML and CSS work.  Hopefully, I will be able to complete the full freeCodeCamp learning circuit and become a Full Stack Developer within the next few years.
